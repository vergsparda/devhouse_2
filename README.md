# devhouse_2
## **Task**
### Write a separe script that calls: [link](http://api.dev.cakeiteasy.no/api/store/bakeries/test-bakery-pay-in-store/?country=NO) and transforms schedule in the response
----------------------------------------
### ![schedule](src\assets\scheduele.PNG)
---------------------------------------
### Into array of strings in the format:
---------------------------------------
```
__For {dayNameStart} - {dayNameEnd}: before {order_before}, {days_before_order}
day(s) before__
```

```
For monday-friday: Before 13:00, 1 day before
```

#### So the main challenge: group similar days: donâ€™t show schedule for each day if a
previous day has the same rules. So in the screenshot above Monday-Friday is the
same, Saturday and Sunday is different
----
#### For day offs please use format

```
{dayName}: closed

```
## Test with other bakeries from the list available via [bakeries](http://api.dev.cakeiteasy.no/api/store/bakeries/?country_code=no)

```
For monday: before 12:00, 2 day(s) before
